# GSON-KSP

This is a ksp plugin to generate type adapter for your GSON model class.

Since most reflection operations at runtime are avoided, it is supposed to be faster than the normal GSON serializaiton/deserializaiton process.

Note this project is still working in progress ðŸš§.

## TODOs

- [ ] Java serialization code generation
- [ ] TypeAdapterFactory generateion
- [ ] Field include/exclude rules support
- [ ] Kotlin support
- [ ] Code generation on demand
